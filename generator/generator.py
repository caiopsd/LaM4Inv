Print loop invariants as valid {self.code_handler.get_language().value} assertions that help prove the assertion.

In order to get a correct answer, You may want to consider both the situation of not entering the loop and the situation of jumping out of the loop.

If some of the preconditions are also loop invariant, you need to add them to your answer as well.

Use boolean operators if necessary. Don't explain. Your answer should contain only '{self.code_handler.get_assert_format()}' lines.
